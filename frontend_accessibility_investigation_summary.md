# Frontend Accessibility Investigation Summary

## Problem Statement
The user reported that the frontend service appeared to start successfully on port 8501 but was not accessible when trying to visit http://127.0.0.1:8501.

## Investigation Process

### 1. Process Status Verification
- **Initial Finding**: The reported PIDs (65456 for backend, 40928 for frontend) were **not running**
- **Actual Status**: Only the backend service was running on PID 55904 on port 8000
- **Frontend Status**: Port 8501 was **not listening** - the frontend service had crashed or was never properly started

### 2. Port Analysis
- **Backend**: Port 8000 was actively listening with a Python process (PID 55904)
- **Frontend**: Port 8501 was completely closed - no process was listening

### 3. Service Accessibility Testing
- **Backend**: Successfully accessible at http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs (returns FastAPI Swagger UI)
- **Frontend**: Not accessible (connection refused) before fix

### 4. Manual Service Startup
- Successfully started the frontend service manually using: `uv run streamlit run app.py --server.address 127.0.0.1 --server.port 8501`
- Service started without errors and began listening on port 8501

### 5. Post-Fix Verification
- **Backend**: Still running and accessible (HTTP 405 Method Not Allowed for HEAD request, but service is responsive)
- **Frontend**: Now accessible (HTTP 200 OK, returning Streamlit HTML content)

## Root Cause Analysis

### Most Likely Cause
The original startup script ([`start_app.py`](scripts/development/start_app.py)) either:
1. **Failed silently** during frontend startup without proper error reporting
2. **Frontend process crashed** shortly after startup due to an unhandled exception
3. **Process management issue** - the frontend subprocess terminated unexpectedly

### Contributing Factors
- The startup script captures stdout/stderr but may not handle all failure scenarios
- Streamlit applications can be sensitive to configuration and dependency issues
- No persistent logging was configured to capture startup failures

## Solution Implemented

### Immediate Fix
1. **Manual Service Startup**: Started the frontend service manually using the correct Streamlit command
2. **Service Verification**: Confirmed both services are now running and accessible

### Current Status
- **Backend**: Running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (FastAPI + Swagger UI)
- **Frontend**: Running on http://127.0.0.1:8501 (Streamlit application)
- **Both services**: Fully accessible and responding to HTTP requests

## Recommendations for Prevention

### 1. Enhanced Logging
- Implement persistent logging for startup scripts
- Capture and save stdout/stderr to log files for debugging
- Add health check endpoints for both services

### 2. Improved Error Handling
- Add retry logic for service startup
- Implement graceful failure handling with clear error messages
- Add service dependency checks before startup

### 3. Monitoring
- Implement service health monitoring
- Add automatic restart capabilities for failed services
- Create startup verification scripts

### 4. Process Management
- Consider using process managers like PM2 or systemd
- Implement proper signal handling for graceful shutdowns
- Add process monitoring to detect and restart crashed services

## Verification Commands
```bash
# Check if services are running
netstat -ano | findstr ":8000 :8501"

# Test backend accessibility
curl -I http://127.0.0.1:8000
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

# Test frontend accessibility  
curl -I http://127.0.0.1:8501

# Check running processes
tasklist /FI "PID eq [PID_NUMBER]"
```

## Conclusion
The frontend accessibility issue was resolved by manually restarting the Streamlit service. The root cause appears to be a startup failure that wasn't properly reported or handled. Both services are now running and accessible as expected.
