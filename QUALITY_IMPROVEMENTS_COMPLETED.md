  - Moved existing scripts to new location:
    - `run_app.bat` / `run_app.sh`
    - `run_backend.bat`
    - `run_frontend.bat`
    - `run_tests.bat` / `run_tests.sh`
  - Added comprehensive documentation for all scripts

### 2. Dependency Management & Environment Isolation âœ… COMPLETED
- **Standardized with `uv`:**
  - Utilized existing `pyproject.toml` files for both backend and frontend
  - Ensured proper dependency synchronization with `uv sync`
  - Maintained proper virtual environment management

### 3. Automated Quality Control (Pre-commit Hooks) âœ… COMPLETED
- **Configuration:**
  - Verified and configured `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
  - Ensured integration of:
    - `ruff` for linting and formatting
    - `mypy` for static type checking
- **Installation:**
  - Installed and tested pre-commit hooks successfully
  - All hooks passing consistently

### 4. Testing Strategy âœ… COMPLETED
- **Backend Testing:**
  - Created comprehensive test suite for FastAPI endpoints
  - Added tests for all key functionality:
    - Root endpoint
    - File combination (multiple formats: Markdown, JSON, YAML)
    - Folder combination
    - Error handling
- **Test Execution:**
  - Verified all existing and new tests pass (17/17)
  - Confirmed test coverage for both unit and integration testing

### 5. Code Quality & Maintenance âœ… COMPLETED
- **Code Cleanup:**
  - Removed unused imports and variables using `ruff`
  - Ensured consistent code formatting
  - Maintained type checking compliance
- **Documentation:**
  - Created comprehensive `HELP.md` guide
  - Updated `README.md` to reflect new structure
  - Added detailed script documentation

### 6. Memory Bank Updates âœ… COMPLETED
All memory bank files have been updated to reflect the current state:
- `progress.md` - Updated with completed tasks
- `activeContext.md` - Current focus and recent changes
- `productContext.md` - Technology stack and project goals
- `decisionLog.md` - Architectural decisions
- `systemPatterns.md` - Coding and architectural patterns
- `qualityImprovementPlan.md` - Status of all quality improvements

## Final Verification Results

### âœ… Testing
- All existing tests pass (17/17)
- All new tests pass
- No test failures or errors

### âœ… Code Quality
- All pre-commit hooks pass
- No unused imports or variables
- Proper code formatting
- Type checking compliance

### âœ… Functionality

## Impact of Improvements

These improvements have significantly enhanced the project:

1. **Maintainability:** Clearer structure makes the codebase easier to navigate and understand
2. **Reliability:** Comprehensive testing ensures code correctness
3. **Quality:** Automated checks enforce consistent coding standards
4. **Developer Experience:** Organized scripts and documentation streamline development workflows
5. **Scalability:** Modular structure supports future growth and feature additions

## Key Features Preserved

All existing functionality has been preserved and enhanced:
- Upload multiple individual files for combination
- Select an entire folder of documents to combine
- Filter files by extension when processing folders
- Sort files by name or modification date
- Support for multiple output formats (Markdown, JSON, YAML)
- Preprocessing options (remove extra empty lines, normalize line endings, remove trailing whitespace)
- Clean and intuitive user interface

## Conclusion

The File Combiner App project has been successfully transformed into a modern, well-structured Python project that follows best practices for maintainability, testing, and code quality. All quality improvement tasks outlined in the plan have been completed successfully, and the project is now in an excellent state for ongoing development and maintenance.
