## Technical Implementation Details

### Backend Changes
- Enhanced the `/combine-folder/` endpoint to support recursive processing
- Added `max_depth` parameter for folder processing depth control
- Implemented relative path handling for better structure visualization
- Optimized directory traversal using `os.scandir()` for performance
- Added proper error handling for permission issues and invalid paths

### Frontend Changes
- Updated the Streamlit interface to include folder depth control
- Enhanced UI to seamlessly support both file uploads and folder selection
- Added clear help text for new functionality
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing features

### Shared Logic Enhancements
- Modified `combine_files_content` function to handle relative paths
- Enhanced JSON and YAML output formats to include folder structure information
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing Markdown format
- Added preprocessing options for content cleaning

## Verification Results

All features have been thoroughly tested and verified:

✅ Recursive folder processing with relative paths  
✅ Multiple output formats (Markdown, JSON, YAML)  
✅ Folder structure visualization  
✅ File sorting by name and date  
✅ Extension filtering  
✅ Content preprocessing options  
✅ Backward compatibility  
✅ Error handling  

## User Benefits Delivered

Users can now:
- Process entire directory structures with a single operation
- Control folder processing depth (0 for unlimited)
- Visualize folder structure in structured outputs
- Filter files by extension
- Sort files by name or modification date
- Apply preprocessing options to clean content
- Export in multiple formats (Markdown, JSON, YAML)
- Continue using existing file upload functionality

## Quality Standards Achieved
