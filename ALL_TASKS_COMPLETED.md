- Restructured backend code into `backend/src/backend/` and `backend/src/shared/`
- Created proper Python package structure with `__init__.py` files
- Updated all imports to reflect new structure
- Modified `Dockerfile` and run scripts for new structure

### 2. Dependency Management
- Verified `pyproject.toml` files for both backend and frontend
- Ensured proper dependency synchronization with `uv sync`
- Maintained proper virtual environment management

### 3. Automated Quality Control
- Verified and configured `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
- Ensured integration of `ruff` and `mypy`
- Successfully installed and tested pre-commit hooks

### 4. Testing Strategy
- Created comprehensive test suite for FastAPI endpoints
- Added tests for all key functionality (17 tests total)
- Verified all existing tests still pass
- Confirmed test coverage for both unit and integration testing

### 5. Development Tooling
- Created `scripts/development/` directory structure
- Moved all development scripts to new location
- Added comprehensive documentation for all scripts
