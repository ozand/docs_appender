# Quality Improvement Summary

This document summarizes all the quality improvements made to the project based on the established guidelines.

## 1. Project Structure & Organization

### Changes Made:
- Restructured the backend to use a `src/` directory layout
- Moved `main.py` and `shared/` directories to `backend/src/backend/` and `backend/src/shared/` respectively
- Updated imports in `main.py` to reflect the new structure
- Updated `Dockerfile` and `run_backend.bat` to work with the new structure
- Created necessary `__init__.py` files to make directories proper Python packages

### Benefits:
- Clearer separation of source code and tests
- Easier to maintain and extend
- Follows Python best practices

## 2. Dependency Management & Environment Isolation

### Changes Made:
- Verified existing `pyproject.toml` files in backend and frontend directories
- Synced dependencies using `uv sync` to ensure all dependencies are up to date
- Confirmed `.venv` is included in `.gitignore` for proper environment isolation

### Benefits:
- Modern dependency management using `uv` and `pyproject.toml`
- Efficient dependency resolution and installation
- Proper environment isolation

## 3. Automated Quality Control (Pre-commit Hooks)

### Changes Made:
- Installed and configured pre-commit hooks
- Ran pre-commit hooks on all files to fix any existing issues
- Verified all hooks (ruff, ruff-format, mypy) are passing

### Benefits:
- Automatic code quality checks on every commit
- Consistent code formatting and linting
- Early detection of type errors

## 4. Testing Strategy

### Changes Made:
- Created a comprehensive test suite for the backend API endpoints
- Organized tests to mirror the `src/` directory structure
- Verified all existing tests for shared logic still pass
- Ran all tests successfully

### Benefits:
- Comprehensive test coverage for both unit and integration tests
- Confidence in code changes and refactoring
- Easier to maintain and extend test suite

## 5. Scripts and Development Tooling

### Changes Made:
- Created `scripts/development/` directory
- Moved all development scripts (`run_*.bat` and `run_*.sh`) to the new directory
- Created a README.md to document the scripts

### Benefits:
- Better organization of development tools
- Easier to find and use development scripts
- Clear documentation for team members

## 6. Code Quality & Refactoring

### Changes Made:
- Ran `ruff check . --select F401,F841 --fix` to remove unused imports and variables
- Ran all pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality
- Ran all tests to ensure functionality is preserved

### Benefits:
- Cleaner codebase with no unused code
- Consistent code style
- Better maintainability

## Overall Impact

These improvements have significantly enhanced the project's maintainability, reliability, and adherence to best practices. The codebase is now better structured, easier to test, and follows modern Python development standards.
