# File Combiner App - Recursive Folder Processing Enhancement

## Project Status: 🎉 **SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED** 🎉

---

## Executive Summary

We have successfully enhanced the File Combiner App with recursive folder processing capabilities. This significant improvement extends the tool's functionality from processing individual files to handling entire directory structures with configurable depth control.

All features have been implemented, thoroughly tested, and verified to work correctly.

## Key Features Implemented

### 📁 Recursive Folder Processing
- **Depth Control**: Configurable maximum depth (0 for unlimited)
- **Efficient Traversal**: Optimized with `os.scandir()` for performance
- **Path Handling**: Proper relative path calculation and management

### 🗺️ Enhanced Output Visualization
- **JSON/YAML**: Include folder path information for better structure visualization
- **Backward Compatibility**: Markdown format unchanged for existing users
- **Structured Data**: Improved organization in structured output formats

### 🎛️ User Interface Improvements
- **Depth Control**: Intuitive input for folder processing depth
- **Seamless Integration**: Unified interface for files and folders
- **Clear Guidance**: Updated help text and documentation

### 🧪 Comprehensive Testing
- **Test Coverage**: Extended to 19 tests covering all new functionality
- **Edge Cases**: Proper handling of permission errors and invalid paths
- **Verification**: Custom scripts confirming all features work correctly
